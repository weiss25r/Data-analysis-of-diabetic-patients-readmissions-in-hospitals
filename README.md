# Predictive-analysis-of-diabetic-patients-readmissions-in-hospitals

Project done for the "Fundamental of Data Analysis" course at University of Catania.
The aim of the project is to build a complete data analysis pipeline on a dataset.
The dataset used is the "Diabetic patients readmissions" dataset, which contains data on diabetic patients who were treated in U.S. hospitals for various conditions besides diabetes. Each patient is labeled as readmitted to the hospital within 30 days, after 30 days, or no longer readmitted. Intuitively, a patient may have been readmitted because they felt ill or because they felt the need for further follow-up.
The pipeline includes:
- Data cleaning
- Exploratory Analysis
- Inferential Analysis, in particular Logistic Regression
- Predictive Analysis, using various model studied during the course.

The following models are used to make predictions:
- Logistic Regression
- Linear Discrimant Analysis
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Multi Layer Perceptron

The last part of the project compare the above classifiers, choosing the best one for the task of classification.
Dimensionality reduction methods like Principal Component Analysis are also used.
